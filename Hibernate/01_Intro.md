# Hibernate Framework

Hibernate is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications to interact with a database.

## Key Features

- **Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool**:
  - It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables, handling the conversion automatically.
  
- **Open source and lightweight**:
  - Hibernate is free to use and does not add significant overhead to Java applications.

- **Non-invasive framework**:
  - Hibernate does not force programmers to extend or implement any specific classes or interfaces.

- **Invented by Gavin King in 2001**:
  - Originally designed to overcome the limitations of earlier frameworks like EJB2.

- **Supports various application types**:
  - Hibernate can be used to build any type of Java application.

## Comparison with JDBC

- **Using JDBC**:
  - Developers must manually write code to store objects (data) into the database using SQL queries.

- **With Hibernate**:
  - The storage of Java objects into the database is automated, reducing the need for manual SQL queries.
