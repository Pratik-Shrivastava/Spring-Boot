# What is JDBC and JDBC Drivers

**JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API for connecting and interacting with databases. JDBC drivers are software components that provide the necessary functionality to connect Java applications to different types of databases.

There are four types of JDBC drivers:

## 1. Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
- Oldest driver.
- Written in C language.
- Performance and scalability issues.
- Not efficient and outdated.

## 2. Type 2: Native-API Partly Java Driver
- Provided by database vendors.
- Platform-specific, relying on native code.
- Has certain restrictions and dependency on database client libraries.

## 3. Type 3: Network Protocol Pure Java Driver
- Uses an intermediary layer, often called middleware.
- Converts JDBC calls into database-specific calls over a network.
- Less efficient compared to the Thin driver.

## 4. Type 4: Thin Driver (Direct to Database Pure Java Driver)
- Directly converts JDBC calls to database-specific calls.
- No middleware, eliminating performance and scalability issues.
- Written entirely in Java, making it platform-independent.

Each type of driver has its own advantages and is suitable for different use cases, depending on factors such as performance, scalability, and the nature of the application.
