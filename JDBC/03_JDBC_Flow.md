# Program Flow for JDBC

This is the general flow for executing database operations using JDBC:

## 1. Connect Your IDE with Database Using Necessary Connector
- Ensure that you have the correct JDBC connector (driver) for your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Add the necessary JDBC driver to your project.

## 2. Load Necessary Drivers
- Use `Class.forName()` to load the required JDBC driver, or ensure it's auto-loaded (depending on your JDBC version).

## 3. Create Connection
- Use the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method to establish a connection to the database.

## 4. Create Statement
- Create either a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` to execute SQL queries against the database.

## 5. Execute Query
- Run the SQL query using the statement and process the results as needed.

This flow outlines the basic steps for working with databases using JDBC in a Java application.
